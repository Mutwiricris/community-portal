## Best Practices

### For Small Groups (1-20 players)
- Use **Multi-Select Mode** for precise control
- Set page size to 25-50 for optimal viewing
- Search and individually select players

### For Medium Groups (20-50 players)
- Use **CSV Upload Mode** with prepared data
- Validate CSV format before upload
- Use 50-100 per page for efficient selection

### For Large Groups (50+ players)
- Use **Community Bulk Mode** for entire communities
- Use **CSV Upload Mode** for mixed community registrations
- Start with smaller page sizes (10-25) for faster initial load

### Performance Optimization
- **Page Size Selection**: 
  - 10 per page: Fastest loading, good for slow connections
  - 25 per page: Balanced performance and usability
  - 50 per page: Good for medium-sized selections
  - 100 per page: Best for bulk operations on fast connections
- **Search Strategy**: Use specific search terms to reduce filtered results
- **Filter First**: Apply community/status filters before browsing pages
- **Select by Page**: Use "Select All on Page" for efficient multi-selection

### Data Preparation
- Ensure all players have valid community assignments
- Verify email addresses match registered users
- Use the CSV template for consistent formatting

## Error Recovery

If bulk registration fails:
1. Check error messages for specific issues
