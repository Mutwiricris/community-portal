  "project": "poolbilliard-167ad", 
  "success": true
}
```

### **Tournament Initialization**
```bash
POST https://thomasngomono.pythonanywhere.com/api/algorithm/initialize-tournament
```
**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "tournamentId": "your_tournament_id",
  "special": false,
  "level": "community",
  "schedulingPreference": "weekend"
}
```

### **Community Round Generation**
```bash
POST https://thomasngomono.pythonanywhere.com/api/algorithm/community/next-round
```
**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "tournamentId": "your_tournament_id",
  "communityId": "your_community_id"
}
```

### **Tournament Finalization**
```bash
POST https://thomasngomono.pythonanywhere.com/api/algorithm/finalize
```
**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "tournamentId": "your_tournament_id",
  "communityId": "your_community_id"
}
```

## üìä Features

### **Intelligent Automation**
- ‚úÖ Automatic bracket generation based on player count and hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Smart round progression with auto-detection of completed rounds
- ‚úÖ Enhanced positioning logic for 1, 2, 3+ player scenarios
- ‚úÖ Community-level management with separate bracket handling
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical tournament support (Community ‚Üí County ‚Üí Regional ‚Üí National)

### **Real-time Monitoring**
- ‚úÖ Algorithm service health monitoring
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics (response time, success rate)
- ‚úÖ Real-time activity logs
- ‚úÖ Automatic error detection and retry logic
- ‚úÖ Community progress tracking

### **Error Handling**
- ‚úÖ Service health checks before each operation
- ‚úÖ Automatic retry on failures (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- ‚úÖ Detailed error logging and user feedback
- ‚úÖ Fallback to manual system if algorithm fails
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation for network issues

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **"Algorithm returned no matches"**
**Cause**: Tournament data doesn't meet algorithm requirements
**Solution**:
1. Ensure tournament has confirmed player registrations
2. Verify players have `communityId` fields populated
3. Check tournament status is `registrations_closed`
4. Confirm minimum 2 players for tournament

### **"Algorithm service offline"**
**Cause**: Cannot connect to online service
**Solution**:
1. Check internet connectivity
2. Verify https://thomasngomono.pythonanywhere.com is accessible
3. Check browser console for CORS or network errors
4. Try manual health check in API documentation modal

### **"Round progression failed"**
**Cause**: Previous round matches not completed
**Solution**:
1. Ensure all matches in current round have `winnerId` and `loserId`
2. Set match status to `completed`
3. Fill in match scores (`player1Score`, `player2Score`)
4. Check community management panel for specific round status

### **Slow response times**
**Cause**: Online service latency or high load
**Expected**: Responses may take 2-5 seconds due to external hosting
**Mitigation**: 
- System automatically retries failed requests
- Monitoring shows response time trends
- 30-second timeout prevents hanging requests

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

### **Monitoring Settings** (Configurable in UI)
- **Check Interval**: 10-300 seconds (default: 30s)
- **Auto Progress**: Enable/disable automatic round advancement
- **Retry Failed**: Enable/disable retry on failed progressions
- **Notifications**: Email, SMS, and push notification settings

### **Tournament Types**
- **Regular Tournament**: Level-based with geographical boundaries
- **Special Tournament**: Mixed players across communities
- **Levels**: Community, County, Regional, National
- **Scheduling**: Weekend-focused or full-week availability

## üîí Security & Performance

### **API Security**
- ‚úÖ HTTPS-only communication with online service
- ‚úÖ Request/response validation and sanitization
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data exposed in logs
- ‚úÖ Timeout protection against hanging requests

### **Performance Optimizations**
- ‚úÖ Efficient polling with configurable intervals
- ‚úÖ Batch operations for multiple communities
- ‚úÖ Response caching for health checks
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of monitoring intervals

## üöÄ Next Steps

### **Ready for Production**
1. ‚úÖ All components implemented and tested
2. ‚úÖ Online API integration verified
3. ‚úÖ Error handling and monitoring in place
4. ‚úÖ UI/UX complete with real-time feedback

### **Optional Enhancements**
- [ ] Add charting library for performance trends visualization
- [ ] Implement push notifications for round completions
- [ ] Add tournament templates for quick setup
- [ ] Create bulk tournament initialization for multiple tournaments

## üéâ Summary
