# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Community Leader Dashboard is an enhanced interface that extends the existing community management portal to include comprehensive tournament management capabilities. This dashboard integrates with the advanced tournament management system to provide community leaders with complete oversight of their local cue sports tournaments, matches, players, and community activities. The dashboard serves as the unified control center where community leaders can manage both community membership and tournament operations, bridging the gap between community management and competitive tournament play within the hierarchical tournament system (Community → County → Regional → National).
