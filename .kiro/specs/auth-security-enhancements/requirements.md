# Authentication Security Enhancements Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing token-based authentication system with comprehensive security measures including XSS protection, token refresh mechanisms, and secure storage options. The goal is to transform the current localStorage-based token system into a production-ready, secure authentication solution that protects against common web vulnerabilities while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: XSS Protection Implementation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious application owner, I want comprehensive XSS protection so that user tokens and sensitive data cannot be stolen through cross-site scripting attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all user inputs SHALL be sanitized and validated before processing
2. WHEN rendering dynamic content THEN the system SHALL use Vue's built-in XSS protection and avoid innerHTML usage
3. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
4. WHEN handling user-generated content THEN the system SHALL sanitize all HTML content before display
5. IF malicious scripts are detected THEN the system SHALL block execution and log the attempt
6. WHEN API responses contain user data THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize before storing or displaying

### Requirement 2: Token Refresh Logic Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to remain active during normal usage without requiring frequent re-authentication, while ensuring expired tokens are automatically refreshed for security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL provide both access token (short-lived) and refresh token (long-lived)
2. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh using the refresh token
3. WHEN a refresh token expires THEN the system SHALL redirect user to login page and clear all stored tokens
4. WHEN API calls return 401 due to expired token THEN the system SHALL attempt token refresh before retrying the original request
5. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL logout the user and clear all authentication data
6. WHEN user is inactive for extended period THEN the system SHALL implement sliding session expiration
7. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN token refresh SHALL be coordinated across all tabs

### Requirement 3: Secure Storage Implementation

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want authentication tokens stored securely using httpOnly cookies in production while maintaining development flexibility, so that tokens cannot be accessed by malicious JavaScript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in production environment THEN the system SHALL store tokens in httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies
2. WHEN in development environment THEN the system SHALL allow localStorage fallback for easier debugging
3. WHEN cookies are set THEN they SHALL include appropriate security flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
4. WHEN user logs out THEN all cookies and localStorage data SHALL be completely cleared
5. WHEN cookies expire THEN the system SHALL handle graceful cleanup and user notification
6. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and use appropriate storage method
7. IF cookie storage fails THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully and notify user of security implications

### Requirement 4: Token Validation and Security Headers

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust token validation and security headers implemented so that the application is protected against common attack vectors and follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are received THEN the system SHALL validate token structure, signature, and expiration
2. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL include appropriate security headers
3. WHEN tokens are malformed or tampered with THEN the system SHALL reject them and force re-authentication
4. WHEN implementing CSP THEN the system SHALL allow only necessary script sources and block inline scripts
5. WHEN user navigates between pages THEN token validity SHALL be verified on each route change
6. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring

### Requirement 5: Session Management and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want transparent session management that handles multiple devices and provides clear feedback about my authentication status and security events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user logs in from multiple devices THEN each session SHALL be tracked independently
2. WHEN user changes password THEN all other sessions SHALL be invalidated
3. WHEN suspicious login activity occurs THEN user SHALL be notified via appropriate channels
4. WHEN session is about to expire THEN user SHALL receive advance warning with option to extend
5. WHEN user manually logs out THEN the system SHALL provide option to logout from all devices
6. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL verify token validity and refresh if needed
7. IF token tampering is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate session and require re-authentication

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the security enhancements to be implemented seamlessly without disrupting my current session or requiring immediate re-authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security updates are deployed THEN existing user sessions SHALL remain valid during transition
2. WHEN localStorage tokens exist THEN the system SHALL migrate them to secure storage on next login
3. WHEN old token format is detected THEN the system SHALL handle graceful upgrade to new format
4. WHEN users have "remember me" enabled THEN the preference SHALL be preserved through security updates
5. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to requiring fresh authentication with clear explanation
6. WHEN rollback is necessary THEN the system SHALL support reverting to previous authentication method
